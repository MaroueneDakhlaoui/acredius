# Welcome To my Acredius Task Submission
Thank you for checking out this project.
The steps to run this project are really simple:
  - Downoad / pull the project.
  - Open the project with any IDE of your chocie (Pycharm, Visual Studio ...) or just the windows terminal (cmd).
  - Using a virtual environment of your choice install requirements from requirements.txt
  (eg 1: for pip, run: pip install -r requirements.txt)
  (eg 2: for pipenv, run: pip install -r requirements.txt)
  - run the report launcher using : python report_launcher.py
  - You're good to go! you have the report explaining all the project steps and output in a browser.<br>
Some additional information :<br>
  - Most of the functions are well commented and seperated from the report and can be found in backend_functions.py.<br>
  - There is a support notebook for the modeling section that the report can redirect you to.<br>
  - The clean excel data that the model used is also available via a google drive redirection url found in the report.<br>
  - Basically once you run the report in your browser you'll find everything.<br><br>
  
  Thank you!
